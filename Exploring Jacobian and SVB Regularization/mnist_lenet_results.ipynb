    "In this notebook I display results in terms of accuracy on test data for LeNet models trained on the MNIST dataset using various regularization techniques. The LeNet model and the MNIST dataset were set up as in Hoffman 2019 (for all the models). The MNIST data is preprocessed by normalizing using mean 0.1307 and variance 0.3081. The batch size is 100. The model optimizes using SGD with momentum p = 0.9, and standard cross-entropy loss. Model parameters are initialized using Glorot initialization (See Glorot & Bengio 2010), expect for SVB regularization which uses orthogonal initialization. Models are trained with no regularization, L2 regularization, SVB regularization and Jacobian regularization, both with and without dropout with a dropout rate of p_drop = 0.5. The L2 regularization coefficient and Jacobian regularization coefficient are the same as in Hoffman 2019: l2_lmbd = 0.0005 and lambda_jacobian_reg = 0.01. For SVB regularization I use the hyperparameters svb_freq=600 and svb_eps = 0.05. The learning rate starts at 0.1, and is reduced to 0.01 and 0.001 1/3 and 2/3s into training, respectively. The models are trained for 250 epochs."
